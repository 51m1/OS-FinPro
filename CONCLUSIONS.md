	This Project was more of an introduction to a more complex topic that is the operation system, but it is a good and interesting way to begin
	this process. If we want to improve our kernel further, we will need to better understand the x86 and what hardware we have available. But this was a
	good start.

	Juan: 

	Even if the end product of this project is kind of "basic", the practice of going through with it brought me some valuable ney experiences. For instance
	even if in other courses like Microcontrollers i could see hoy C code was translated into assembly, this is the first time that i have had the chance to mess
	around with files that are written using lenguages with different levels of abstranction (C and assembly) and interact with each other. Even if the actual 
	resulting kernell lacks almost all functionality I still think this was a very nice oportunity.

	Thanks to the guide we followed we could create the kernel without running into too much trouble, the documentation was a big help and
	got us out of trouble most of the times. The bad thing about this is that we couldnâ€™t add morefeatures to it since we are short on time and needed to
	work on other projects.
